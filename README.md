Welcome to the Advanced Chat Moderation Skript, your all-in-one solution for managing chat moderation on your Minecraft server! This Skript is designed to give server admins powerful tools to keep their community peaceful and enjoyable. Whether you need to mute, kick, or ban players, this Skript makes it easy.

üåü Features
This Skript offers a variety of features that make it stand out:

Easy-to-Use Commands: Quickly mute, unmute, kick, ban, and unban players with straightforward commands. Designed with simplicity in mind, these commands are perfect for administrators who want effective control over server moderation.

Reason Specification: Whenever you mute, kick, or ban someone, you can specify a reason. This reason will be shown to the player and broadcast to the server, promoting transparency.

View Muted and Banned Players: Use simple commands to see a list of all currently muted and banned players, keeping track of who has been moderated.

UUID-Based Moderation: This Skript uses UUIDs to track players, which means it works even if players change their usernames.

üëç Pros
The Advanced Chat Moderation Skript is user-friendly, highly customizable, and efficient. It allows you to manage your server's chat environment with ease, providing clear notifications and allowing you to set reasons for actions. The bypass permissions are great for maintaining control, and the ability to manage offline players gives you the flexibility needed for effective moderation.

üëé Cons
While this Skript is powerful, it does have some limitations. It relies on UUID handling, which may require additional plugins or Skript add-ons to display names correctly. Additionally, player data is stored in memory and may not persist after a server restart unless specific measures are taken to save this data. The manual process for unbanning players might also be less convenient for larger servers.

üîß Installation Instructions
Ensure you have the latest version of the Skript plugin installed on your server.
Place the .sk file in your Skript scripts folder.
Use the /skript reload <filename> command to load the Skript.
Customize messages and permissions as needed within the Skript file to suit your server's theme.
